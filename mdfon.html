            Kabsa is a rice-based dish that is typically made with chicken or lamb, although some variations use fish or shrimp. The rice is flavored with a blend of aromatic spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves, and is often cooked with onions, tomatoes, and peppers.

            <li>Prepare Kabsa seasoning mix. Please note: if you don't like your food strongly seasoned, use less of the blend that this recipe makes. You can also purchase Kabsa mix from your local Middle Eastern market. Some blends are very spicy- so if you like that please increase the amount of paprika in mine.</li>
            <li>Soak rice for 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Season chicken lightly on all sides with a tablespoon of the seasoning mix.</li>
            <li>Add oil to deep pot and set to medium high heat. When oil is hot, fry chicken in oil until golden on all sides, 2 min per side. If the oil is not hot enough, the skin will get stuck to the pan when you’re trying to turn it over.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and in the same pot, add onion, garlic, ginger, carrots, tomatoes and peas. Sauté for a few minutes then add 1/4 cup cashews and 1/4 cup golden raisons, stir in a couple tablespoons of the seasoning, and add the chicken back in. Cook another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the chicken broth, cinnamon, bay leaf. Cook over medium high heat. When boil starts, lower the temp. Let them cook until the water is absorbed. There is need to stir while cooking. It typically takes 20 min or so.</li>
            <li>Garnish with some golden raisons, almonds and pine nuts and or cashews!</li>
